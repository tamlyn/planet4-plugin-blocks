This WordPress plugin provides the necessary blocks to be used with Shortcake UI plugin.

**How to develop a new block you ask?**

1. Create a new controller class that extends P4BKS_Blocks_Controller inside directory _classes/controller/blocks_. The class name should follow naming convention, for example P4BKS_Blocks_**Blockname**_Controller and its file name should be class-p4bks-blocks-**blockname**-controller.php. 

2. Implement its parent's class two abstract methods. In method **prepare_fields()** you need to define the blocks fields and in method **prepare_template()** you need to prepare them for rendering.

3. Create the template file that will be used to render your block inside directory _includes/blocks_. If the name of the file is **block_name**.twig then
you need to override method load() and set the inherited property inside like this **$this->block_name = 'block_name'** It also works with html templates. Just add 'php' as the 3rd argument of the block() method.

4. Add your new class name to the array that the P4BKS_Loader function takes as an argument in the plugin's main file.

5. Finally, before committing do **composer update --no-dev** and **composer dump-autoload --optimize** in order to add your new class to composer's autoload.

_(Steps 4, 5 will not be necessary later on, since we will use our own autoloading instead of Composer's autoloader)_
